Problem 3 (10pts/8pts):
Modify Problem #1 above, but store y in a scatter distribution (aka wrap-mapped) distribution. For this
case, from global coeffient J on Q processes, then local index is j = J/Q, q = J mod Q, and the number of
elements per process is the same as in the linear load-balanced distribution would produce with N elements
over Q partitions.
